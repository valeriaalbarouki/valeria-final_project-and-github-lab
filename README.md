## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Some ideas for my final project is possibly a fan-made game. I would really be interested in creating a game similar to crossy road or flappy bird, but make it sanrio/hello kitty themed. Regardless of what I choose, I would like to make a game and incorporate hello kitty into it.
