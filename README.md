# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Some ideas for my final project is possibly a fan-made game. I would really be interested in creating a game similar to crossy road or flappy bird, but make it sanrio/hello kitty themed. Regardless of what I choose, I would like to make a game and incorporate hello kitty into it.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
N/A


## Do you have any questions of your own?
No questions :)



# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Mario Pye Track (for now)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A spinoff of the game Super Mario Brothers, adding on to the "Mario track." We are planning to create a game similar to Super Mario Brothers.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My group is planning on creating a game based on the Mario track. Our software will be a side-scrolling platform game where the player moves to the right to reach the flagpole at the end of each level. Our game features will include a character who will represent the player, different tracks like levels and graphics, and possibly obstacles to give the player some challenge throughout the game. We would also like to add some sort of text to give the game a storyline to follow along with, just like in the original Super Mario Brothers!

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Rameen Abid
- rameen.abid@temple.edu
- Xinwen (Ellen) Zhang
  
Jaehwan Jeong
- jaehwan.jeong@temple.edu
- Elmira Talebianaraki


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
- Background graphics
- Character to represent the player (A spin on Mario)
- Storyline
- The player will be able to complete a level
- Added obstacles


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
- Music track
- Multiple levels
- Advanced graphics


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
- Ability to pick between multiple characters to play as
- Easy, Medium, and Hard game modes
- Powerups for the player


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some new skills we will need to acquire could be learning the LUA language, which the Mario track is programmed in. Or, we might have to brush up on our Python skills if we choose to program the game in PYTHON. Topics we will need to research are how to add sound effects and background music to our code, as well as playing around with different game engines like LOVE2D or possibly Unity. Another important thing we will need to research is game progression to be able to implement progression between levels, saving high scores, and showing completion screens.
